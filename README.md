#### Researchers
Recently, many college  students and friends contacted me, hoping to use these data for scientific research. However, not everyone is familiar with the use of APIs and the format of JSON, so here is the soon data warehouse to publish the latest data in CSV format, which can be easily processed and loaded by most software.

The data is obtained by COVID-19 Infection Data Realtime Crawler. The data will be published hourly.


#### JSON File List

Due to the instability of API, this project will also push latest static JSONs into the json folder. Data from JSON files are exactly the same as the data responded from the API.

Data customization is not accepted. If you have more requirements for data, please handle it on your own.
